Hi, my name is **Guilherme Crespo**! I am a **software developer** and have experience working with:

- HTML (5) & CSS (3)
- Javascript (ES6+)
- React (+ Redux, + Hooks)
- WebComponents (+ LitElement)
- Node.js (+ Express, + Sequelize)
- Python (+ FastAPI, + Scrapy, + SQLAlchemy)
- GraphQL / MySQL / MongoDB

I am used to working with GitHub and GitLab in an agile (and remote - with both synchronous and asynchronous activities) environment.

I am always willing to learn new tools and languages, and to get to know in more depth the ones I already work with.
